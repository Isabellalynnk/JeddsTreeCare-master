    <h1>Emerald Ash Borer</h1>
    <p>Emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, is an <strong>exotic beetle</strong> that was discovered in south eastern Michigan near Detroit in the summer of 2002. The adult beetles nibble on ash foliage but cause little damage. The larvae (the immature stage) feed on the inner bark of ash trees, disrupting the tree's ability to transport water and nutrients. Emerald ash borer probably arrived in the United States on solid wood packing material carried in cargo ships or airplanes originating in its native Asia. As of October 2018, it is now found in 35 states, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Manitoba.</p>
    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>An EAB beetle's lifespan ranges from <strong>1-2 years</strong> in North America.</li>
      <li>The EAB beetle kills ash trees by destroying the water and nutrient conducting tissues under the tree's bark.</li>
      <li>The Emerald Ash Borer is spread through the moving of firewood from it's initial location.</li>
      <li>The beetle is currently found in Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISU experts encourage Iowa homeowners to evaluate their ash treeâ€™s health and value in the landscape, and their commitment to years of preventive treatments. If an ash tree is within 15 miles of a known EAB infestation, preventive treatments are suggested for individual trees.</p>
    <p>Emerald ash borer threatens the entire North American genus Fraxinus. It has killed at least tens of millions of ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the 8.7 billion ash trees throughout North America. Like some other exotic pests that affect plants and trees, it is believed to have been accidentally introduced to North America in imported wood packaging or crating material.</p>
    <p>Preventing the Spread of the Emerald Ash Borer. Since this pest is highly destructive, the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development (MDARD) placed a quarantine on all ash trees, ash wood products, and all non-coniferous firewood (hardwoods), in the affected counties to prevent and control its spread.</p>
    <p>Applying protective insecticide treatments to a healthy ash tree to prevent an EAB infestation is the best strategy for managing EAB. However, if a tree becomes infested and the infestation is detected early, you may be able to treat your ash tree to prevent further damage, and help the tree recover. When applied correctly, EAB treatment is 85 to 95 percent effective. EAB treatment works to save trees in your yards and your city.</p>
    <p>Efforts to stop it since then have been futile as it can now be found in 30 states and is continuing to spread. While we may be able to temporarily slow expansion of the emerald ash borer, our ash trees are most likely, in the long run, doomed. These two pests are not the only problems.</p>
